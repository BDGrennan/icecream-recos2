       " 'So it s the middle of June and I made an impromptu decision to get a small thing of ice cream during my shopping trip I initially was thinking of going for a strawberry or peach flavor but then I saw this pint and had a double take I d never try this flavor prior and man I do not regret it I love this pint I love sweet cream and blonde brownie so this was a win win I like how to salted caramel is in the center so I have the ability to control how much I want in each bite I do agree that the salted caramel is a bit on the salty side but like I said I have the control to put as little as I want in my scoop ',\n",
       " 'I ll be completely honest I m not generally a fan of caramel it s just too sweet for me but I gave this flavor a shot because of the sweet cream ice cream As it turns out the saltiness of the caramel core perfectly balances out the sweetness I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the salted caramel core The blonde brownie chunks were also a nice touch and not too overwhelming I feel like the ratio of mix ins to chunks was nicely balanced ',\n",
       " 'Okay I was expecting an almost too salty weirdly over sweet ice cream but man was I wrong  No seriously  I started eating this ice cream and was transported to the first time I had gooey caramel pop corn  the ice cream was like eating sweet corn creamy and smooth and the chewy bits supposed to be brownie tasted like caramel pop corn that had gotten chewy and sweet soaked in ice cream  then the salty caramel center was too good to even say but together the best caramel pop corn ice cream I have ever had  even though I don t know if that s what they were going for lol  my favorite flavor so far',\n",
       " 'This was my st pint of Salted Caramel Core but not my first Ben and Jerry s Core pint My first impression was that my core was HUGE It was literally overflowing when I opened the pint Wow And the caramel itself was delicious salty sweet and gooey The sweet cream ice cream was very rich and cut through the sweet of the core nicely My only issue was the blonde brownie bits It s not that they weren t plentiful I just really didn t like the taste of them which is sad because the rest of the pint was KILLER The chocolate brownies in the other flavors are amazingly good so I was disappointed that these blonde ones weren t very good and I ate around them So all in all it was a good pint with amazing caramel good ice cream and funky brownies ',\n",
       " 'This is my all time favorite flavor For me it s the perfect combination of sweet and salty and its upsetting to see so many people hate on it I think vanilla would be too over powering but everyone s taste buds are different I do agree the blonde brownie bits have been lacking  but I m an eat the entire pint kinda gal  oops sit down to a good movie and this is my go to snack to grab wish it came in a dairy free option but I live in WI so I suffer through being lactose intolerant all the time So in short it is sweet and salty flavor I always have a partial scoop of ice cream to core spoonful I eat and I guess I m the weirdo that runs outta caramel before ice cream  oops xD',\n",
       " 'I love carmel so much and as soon as I saw carmel core I grabbed it off the shelf The carmel tastes great and I love the ice cream and blonde brownie pieces in it  The only thing that is wrong with it is how much carmel they gave me It was   carmel and   ice cream It wasn t a good balance and I probably won t get it again ',\n",
       " 'I always wanted a flavor of ice cream that was tailored to the way my taste buds worked Most ice cream flavors from other companies that have cookie dough in it is chocolate based but Ben  Jerry s has cornered the market this cookie dough is caramel and butter and cookie based or blondie if that s the correct term  I ve been buying it almost every weekend at college for a year Please keep this flavor it makes me so happy The fact that there s a cookie dough flavor that is chocolate free is one of a kind and not many ice companies make that ',\n",
       " 'I was so excited to try the core pints The picture they show online makes it look like a decent size and width The reality the core of my salted caramel pint was the width of a pencil eraser tip Incredibly disappointing and   not as advertised I feel duped ',\n",

       " 'This was the best s more flavored edible substance I have ever consumed Every time I saw Limited Batch on the label I dreaded the day that would be my last time seeing it on the shelves Mercy shone upon me each time though as upon return to my home all the dread melted away as I rejoiced and beheld Heaven s essence grace my mouth with the textured creamy delight of Gimme S more Alas the day finally encroached upon my innocent self that I would see in its stead  One Love  I ve since settled for Milk Cookies which I know can never fill the void once occupied by the dessert of unmatched divinity I dream that one day I ll once again taste the treasure graciously gifted to this unworthy world by the great Ben and Jerry ',\n",

       " 'As a long time fan of Ben  Jerry s I have favorite flavors I always want Being summer and seeing the store did not have any of my favorites I thought I would try this new flavor I have to say it is not at all what I was hoping for I am a marshmallow junkie and was hoping for toasted marshmallow flavor instead I felt like I was eating vanilla chocolate chip with some of those cake crunchies that you find in ice cream cakes I will go back to my regular flavors or skip buying if Gimme S more is my only other option ',\n",
       " 'I have been a hard core regular cookie dough ice cream only fan for YEARS but this flavor caught my eye at the beginning of summer and I haven t been able to buy any other ice cream since It s the amazing cookie swirl that almost convinced me that I could love the Tonight Dough flavor despite my hatred for the nasty peanut butter dough And the ever so creamy toasted marshmellow ice cream was a pleasant surprise Even the graham cracker swirl blends in perfectly so you don t feel like you have random dry crumbs messing up the texture It s the perfect combination that at times tastes like what an Oreo ice cream should taste like I haven t had my go to cookie dough ice cream in over  months and will be incredibly sad when this masterpiece goes away ',\n",
       " 'This flavor does not remind me of S mores at all Why cookies The chocolate flakes are more like big pieces  too big for this I couldn t even finish the container It wasn t worth it first time I ve done that with Ben  Jerry s Hopefully you ll never quit making the original S mores even if they are only in the shops ',\n",

       " 'I really enjoyed this flavor I was excited to try this flavor because the other s mores flavor has chocolate has the ice cream which I personally don t like so I was very happy to see this one with a marshmallow ice cream I will say marshmallow is a hard flavor to replicate so the ice cream tasted more like vanilla to me This flavor would have benefited from marshmellow bits mixed in The chocolate cookie swirl and graham cracker swirl were amazing and crunchy These swirls delivered on the s mores flavor for me ',\n",
       " 'I love s mores and don t get me wrong this flavor is great but not what I wanted I was expecting more of a s mores flavor and I would explain this ice cream as more of a marshmallow cookie crunch  It s still good Just not s mores It would be better with gooey marshmallows  ',\n",
       " 'I just bought this as well as my staple cookie dough Cookie dough was as usual amazing but this one was just a miss for me It reminded me of the pint slices not nearly enough toppings or pieces It was mostly vanilla ice cream with some cookie pieces in it Definitely not enough marshmallows to make it feel like a s mores ice cream Anyway I love most of B Js flavors but this one wasn t for me',\n",
       " 'I like ice cream and I eat a fair amount of it but never have I had an ice cream that haunts my dreams like this one This ice cream might actually be perfect The toasted marshmallow base is excellent and not too sweet and the flakes of chocolate add the perfect crunch to the blend I m not a big chocolate ice cream fan and I think that making the base marshmallow allows all of the flavors to be appreciated as one instead of being overpowered by chocolate However by far my favorite part of this ice cream is the graham cracker fudge swirl Holy moley It has a fantastic texture and the taste leads me on a whirlwind adventure I don t know what I have to do to make this more than just a limited batch but I will do it Every time I go to the grocery store I hold my breath that it will still be there waiting for me cool and delicious ',\n",
       " 'This is my new favorite ice cream While I agree that the base ice cream is not an exact replica of marshmallows it does not taste like plain vanilla  more like the melted gooey inside of a marshmallow that s not actually warm or gooey The add ins are perfection to me between the swirls graham and chocolate cookie I m in ice cream heaven I have to carefully calculate my purchases so this is the only cheat on my diet each week I hope it goes from limited batch to here to stay ',\n",

       " 'I have been buying this consistently for about  weeks almost like twice a week because I cannot get enough of this flavor It s honestly unhealthy for me at this point and for my bank account because I barely bought ice cream before taking a chance on this one Delicious The cookies and graham crackers are amazing in it I literally went through the process of giving my info just so I could write this review in hopes that the flavor is continued and more people improve upon their lives by buying this flavor ',\n",

       " 'It s vanilla ice cream not toasted marshmallow That alone was extremely disappointing A little graham cracker swirl was ok Just didn t go with the ice cream I did like the chocolate cookie swirl It basically was a cookies and cream ice cream taste Only a little bit of fudge flakes but that s fine with me Extremely disappointed I love marshmallow ',\n",

       " 'Ben and Jerry s PLEASE keep this one around I loved the old S mores too but this one is so much better I know most flavors end up in the graveyard but if this one ends up in the graveyard it will be a tradgedy on par with human trafficking ',\n",
